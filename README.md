This project is to develop to simplify the everyday complicated task performed by the people and securing valuable things. The car shed is built with finest technology used today. The car owns the shed by its automatic reverse system provided by the shed .The shed can be operate with owners smart device even if the owner is in another side of the world.
When unauthorized subjects try to open the shutter without the consent of the owner, the shutter remains locked. The shutter will open by face recognition, number plate recognition. It’s the owner’s choice to choose the subject of shutter. If the face of the subject is not recognized by the help of smart devices, the owner can decide what to do.  
The RFID sensor is used for scanning they could present in the vehicle .
        This function is performed when the face recognition fails to recognize the subject. The PIR sensor located in the shed performs the function of producing a time delay of closing the shutter while the owner just moved outside.
        When the car is been park by the owner the backside of the car faces the shutter, so it is not easy to reverse the car from the inside. That’s why the circular platform automatically rotates 180degree. This makes it easy to move the car outside.

IOT technology is been used in the shed which gives the owner complete control over the shed using the internet
